## 🛠 Methodology

### **📌 1. Data Collection**
- **Diabetes:** PIMA Indian dataset, UCI ML Repository
- **Liver Disease:** ILPD benchmark dataset, Taipei City Hospital records
- **Heart Disease:** UCI repository (Hungarian, Switzerland, Cleveland patients)
- **Parkinson’s Disease:** PPMI dataset

### **📌 2. Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling & encoding
- Removing duplicates

### **📌 3. Model Training**
- Algorithms used: **XGBoost, Decision Trees, KNN, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM**
- Data split: **80% training, 20% testing**

### **📌 4. Model Deployment**
- Trained models saved as **Pickle (.pkl) files**
- Integrated with Flask API for real-time predictions
